## Installing dependencies and how to run 

npm create vite@latest assign
cd assign
npm install axios react-router-dom
npm run dev- to run the project

## Functionality
1. Authentication Screen
-> Login using correct credentials
-> The background theme keeps changing
2. Users List
-> You can see the list of users
-> You can move to next and previous page
-> You can search for user
-> You can edit or delete a user
4. Edit User
-> On clicking on update the api response is showing 200(Success) but I think api is not changing the data hence it is not getting reflected.
